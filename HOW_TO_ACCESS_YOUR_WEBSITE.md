# 🌐 How to Access Your KIVU Marketplace Website

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: localhost is NOT my computer - it's YOURS!

`localhost:3000` means the website is running on **YOUR** computer/server in the Emergent environment.

---

## 🚀 How to Access Your Website

### Method 1: Emergent Preview (RECOMMENDED)

Your website is running in your **Emergent workspace**. Look for:

1. **Preview Button** in your Emergent dashboard (usually top-right)
2. **Preview URL** - something like:
   - `https://your-workspace.emergent.sh`
   - or a similar URL provided by Emergent

**Click that button or use that URL** - that's your live website!

---

### Method 2: If You're on the Same Computer

If you're working directly on the server/computer where the app is running:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

**But this only works if you're on the actual server machine.**

---

## 📱 All Your Website Pages

Once you have the correct URL (from Emergent preview), you can access:

### Public Pages:
- **Home**: `/`
- **Products**: `/products`
- **About**: `/about`
- **Contact**: `/contact`
- **Login**: `/login`
- **Register**: `/register`

### After Login (Buyers):
- **My Orders**: `/orders`
- **Cart**: `/cart`
- **Checkout**: `/checkout`

### After Login (Sellers):
- **My Products**: `/seller/products`
- **Add Product**: `/seller/add-product`

### Admin Panel:
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin`
  - Must login with: `admin@kivu.market`

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

To test if your site is working:

1. Find your Emergent preview URL
2. Visit: `[your-url]/about`
3. You should see the "About KIVU Marketplace" page

## ✅ Seller Product Upload NOW WORKING!

I just created the **Seller Product Upload** pages! Here's how it works:

### For Sellers:

1. **Register as Seller**:
   - Go to `/register`
   - Select "Seller" account type
   - Fill in details and register

2. **Add Products**:
   - After login, click your name in top-right
   - Click "Add Product"
   - OR go directly to: `/seller/add-product`

3. **Fill Product Form**:
   - ✅ Product Name
   - ✅ Description (detailed)
   - ✅ Category (dropdown with all 18 categories)
   - ✅ Regular Price
   - ✅ Pool Price (group buying price)
   - ✅ Images (add URLs of product photos)

4. **Image URLs**:
   - Use free image sites like:
     - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com
     - Pexels: https://pexels.com
   - Copy image URL and paste it
   - Add multiple images
   - See preview before submitting

5. **Submit**:
   - Click "Submit for Approval"
   - Product goes to admin for review
   - You'll see it in "My Products" with status:
     - 🟡 **Pending** - Waiting for admin approval
     - 🟢 **Approved** - Live on marketplace
     - 🔴 **Rejected** - Not approved

6. **View Your Products**:
   - Go to `/seller/products`
   - See all your submitted products
   - Check their approval status

---

## 🔐 Admin Approval Process

When a seller submits a product:

1. Product appears in Admin Panel
2. Admin goes to: `/admin`
3. Clicks "Pending Products" tab
4. Reviews product:
   - Name, description
   - Category
   - Prices
   - Photos
5. Admin can:
   - ✅ **Approve** - Product goes live on marketplace
   - ❌ **Reject** - Product rejected (with reason)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I can't access localhost:3000"
**Solution**: Use your Emergent preview URL instead! localhost only works on the server itself.

### "Where's my preview URL?"
**Solution**: Look in your Emergent dashboard:
- Top-right corner for "Preview" button
- Or check workspace settings
- Contact Emergent support if needed

### "Seller can't add products"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you registered as "Seller" (not "Buyer")
- Make sure you're logged in
- Go to `/seller/add-product`

### "Admin panel is blank"
**Solution**:
- Must login with email: `admin@kivu.market`
- Any other email cannot access admin panel
